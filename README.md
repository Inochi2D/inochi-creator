Inochi Creator is tool to create and edit [Inochi2D puppets](https://github.com/Inochi2D/inochi2d).

## For package maintainers
We do not officially support packages that we don't officially build ourselves, we ask that you build using the barebones configurations, as the branding assets are copyright the Inochi2D Project.  
You may request permission to use our branding assets in your package by submitting an issue.

Barebones builds are more or less equivalent to official builds with the exception that branding is removed,  
and that we don't accept support tickets unless a problem can be replicated on an official build.

## What package formats are/will be officially supported?
Anything we upload to the Releases page is officially supported, as well as anything that is linked to on our official website (TBA).  
We currently plan to distribute Inochi Creator in the following formats:
 - Windows MSI Installer
 - Linux AppImage
 - macOS DMG

## Under Construction
Inochi Creator is currently under construction and is not recommended for production use.

## Intel Integrated Graphics
Inochi Creator currently crashes on Intel Integrated Graphics. I unfortunately do not have the means to debug and fix this issue right now, sorry.
